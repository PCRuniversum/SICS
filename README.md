# PCRedux package - Case Study

In this case study we used 400 amplification curves from the *kbqPCR* dataset 
from and assign them to the object *curves*. A comprehensive PDF version 
(including domain knowledge about qPCRs and machine learning) of this document 
is available **[online 
supplement](https://github.com/devSJR/PCRedux/raw/master/docs/articles/PCRedux.pdf)**. This online document contains additional code (incl. installation of the 
software, data import, preprocessing)) that helps to understand how this 
introductionary case study was created. Before we start we need to load 
additional libraries (some from CRAN, some from github.com).
